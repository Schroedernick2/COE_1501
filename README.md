<b>PROJECTS</b>
<br>

<b>1. Project1 </b>
<br>
<br>
The goal of Project1 was to determine and visualize the cutting of a cloth to maximize its value.
<br>
Given a cloth: [width,height], the program cuts the cloth into <i>n</i> products where each product has a width, height, and value.
For more information see project README.
<br>
<br>
<b>2. Project2 </b>
<br>
<br>
The goal of Project2 was to develop an anagram decoder. Given a dictionary file and a single anagram, the program outputs all possible phrases the anagram could possibly be.
For more information see project README.
<br>
<br>
<b>3. Project3 </b>
<br>
<br>
The goal of Project3 was to implement Prim's Algorithm and the MST-Walk Algorithm to approximately solve the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem.
For more information see project README.
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Project4 </b>
<br>
<br>
The goal of project4 was to use Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm to find the longest shared substring between two supplied strings.
For more information see project README.
